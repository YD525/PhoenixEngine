## 🔥 PhoenixEngine

**PhoenixEngine** is a high-performance, multi-threaded language translation engine.  
It combines **AI-powered translation** with **context generation**, and features **text segmentation** and **priority-based ordering** to deliver more natural and context-aware results.

## 🌙 SSEATTransCore (Lite Version)

The Lite version of the translation core is available here:  
**https://github.com/YD525/SSEATTransCore**

This version is built on **.NET Framework**, so **end users do not need to install any runtime**.  
Compared to the full version, it **removes several AI platform integrations**, resulting in a **smaller and more lightweight** build.

This Lite edition is jointly maintained by the authors of **SSEAT** and **SSELex**.
